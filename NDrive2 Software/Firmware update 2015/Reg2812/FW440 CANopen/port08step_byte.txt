Bit Meaning
0  generic error
1  current
2  voltage
3  temperature
4  communication error (overrun, error state)
5  device profile specific
6  reserved
7  manufacturer specific

1016:
Heartbeat Consumer Entries

time and thus has to be higher than the corresponding producer heartbeat
time configured on the device producing this heartbeat.
